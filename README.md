### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**TheCodingRocket/TheCodingRocket** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Web Develpment

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Game Development

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with a Pathfinding Algorithm

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Javascript

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: My Email > anitahartanto178@gmail.com

- âš¡ Fun fact: Neutron stars can spin at a rate of 600 rotations per second.

- ðŸ”­ Library: I use a Javascript Library called p5.js, for all my Javascript games

- ðŸŒ± Python: I use Jupyter Notebook for Data sciences and Statistics

- ðŸ‘¯ In Summary: Practice, practice, practice... and when you feel you want to quit, DON'T.
